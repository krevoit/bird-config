# bird-config
(An attempt at) a BIRD IPv4 and IPv6 config to run with SBIX DUS, DE-CIX Dusseldorf and other Internet Exchange Points.
This is not a production config, please do not just copy it to your server and start running it, you may break the internet.
Original config from git.rappet.de, but the site is now down :(
